# Dev log

One entry per work session: what you did, what you measured, what's next.
Future you (and anyone reading the repo) will thank you.

## 2026-10-10: Phase 0 scaffold

- Project structure, config files, event bus, shared state, telemetry,
  kill switch, free LLM fallback, language switching (en/si/ta).
- 43 unit tests passing. Text chat checked end to end against a local
  OpenAI-compatible test server (streaming, tool calls, Sinhala/Tamil replies,
  kill switch, telemetry summary).
- Smoke test written. Its Whisper and MediaPipe parts are checked against the
  library APIs (MediaPipe 1.1, faster-whisper 1.2) but have not run on real
  hardware yet.

**Next:** run `scripts/smoke_test.py` on the laptop (English, then Sinhala or
Tamil) and record the numbers here: Whisper speed, hand tracking FPS, FPS drop
while Whisper runs, LLM first-token times.
